    <h1>CONTACT US</h1>
  Here’s what to include on a good “Contact Us” page** — with clear explanations you can use as the actual content or copy text on your own page:<br>



<h2> What a Contact Us Page Is</h2>

A *Contact Us* page is a dedicated webpage that helps visitors reach your business or support team. It typically lists ways to contact you directly, including a form, phone, email, and other useful info.<br> 

</p>

<h2> Essential Information to Include<br>

<p>1. Clear Headline<br></h2>

This should tell visitors immediately what the page is for, for example:<br>
“Get in Touch with Nitin Booking” or
“We’d Love to Hear from You”. <br></p>



<h2><p>2. Contact Form<br></h2>

A simple form helps users send messages directly through the website. Typical fields include:<br></p>

Name<br>
Email<br>
Message / Inquiry<br>
  You can also add optional fields like phone number or subject.<br> 
This form is usually the central element of the page and should be easy to fill out.<br>
</p>

 <h2><p>3. Direct Contact Details<br></h2>

Include clear ways people can get in touch without a form:<br>

Email address<br>
Phone number<br>
Physical address (if applicable)<br>
Business hours<br>
  These help build trust and let users choose their preferred contact method. <br></p>

<h2><p>4. Response Expectations<br></h2>

Let users know how long it typically takes for you to reply:<br>

“We reply to all inquiries within 24–48 hours”<br>
 Setting expectations encourages more engagement. <br></p>



<h2><p>5. Social Media Links<br></h2></p>
<p>Adding links to Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc., gives users more ways to interact with you.<br> </p>


<h2><p>6. Optional Extras (Helpful but Not Required)<br></h2>

Location Map – Shows your physical address on a map (Google Maps or image). <br>
Help or FAQ links – Useful if visitors might need answers before contacting.<br>
Live Chat or Support Links – For real-time help. <br></p>
